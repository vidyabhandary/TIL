# AWS Security Tools

Table summarizing the key differences between AWS Inspector, AWS GuardDuty, and AWS Detective:

| Feature               | AWS Inspector                                                                                                       | AWS GuardDuty                                                                                                               | AWS Detective                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Purpose**   | Vulnerability Management & Configuration Assessment                                                                 | Intelligent Threat Detection                                                                                                | Security Investigation & Root Cause Analysis                                                                               |
| **Focus Area**        | Known software vulnerabilities (CVEs), unintended network exposure, configuration benchmarks.                       | Malicious activity, unauthorized behavior, account compromise, anomalies.                                                   | Understanding the scope, context, and history of security findings.                                                        |
| **Nature**            | **Proactive:** Scans for _existing_ weaknesses.                                                                     | **Reactive:** Detects _ongoing or recent_ threats.                                                                          | **Investigative:** Analyzes data _after_ a finding occurs.                                                                 |
| **How it Works**      | Scans EC2 instances, ECR images, Lambda functions against vulnerability databases and network reachability rules.   | Analyzes AWS logs (CloudTrail, VPC Flow, DNS, EKS Audit, etc.) using ML, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence.        | Ingests findings/logs (from GuardDuty, CloudTrail, etc.), builds a graph model, correlates data, visualizes relationships. |
| **Data Sources Used** | Agent-based or agentless scans of resources (EC2, ECR, Lambda), network configuration analysis.                     | CloudTrail Logs, VPC Flow Logs, DNS Logs, EKS Audit Logs, RDS Login Activity, S3 Data Events, Lambda Network Activity, etc. | GuardDuty Findings, CloudTrail Logs, VPC Flow Logs, EKS Audit Logs, Security Hub Findings (processed for context).         |
| **Key Output**        | Findings reports detailing vulnerabilities, network exposures, and compliance checks with severity.                 | Security Findings/Alerts detailing suspicious activity with severity levels.                                                | Interactive visualizations, consolidated timelines, relationship graphs, summaries to aid investigation.                   |
| **Main Use Case**     | Identifying needed patches, securing network configurations, regular security posture checks, compliance reporting. | Detecting compromised resources, unusual API activity, potential data exfiltration, malware activity, credential misuse.    | Deep-diving into a GuardDuty finding, understanding the blast radius of an incident, tracing attacker steps.               |
| **Analogy**           | **Health Check-up:** Scans for known potential health problems (like checking for high cholesterol).                | **Security Alarm System:** Detects active break-ins or suspicious activity in real-time.                                    | **Detective/Investigator:** Arrives after the alarm, gathers clues, interviews witnesses, and figures out what happened.   |
| **Integration**       | Can send findings to Security Hub. Integrates with Systems Manager for patching.                                    | Sends findings to Security Hub, EventBridge. Findings are a primary input for Detective.                                    | Ingests data from GuardDuty, Security Hub, etc. Visualizes data from multiple sources.                                     |

**In simple terms:**

- **Inspector:** Looks for known weaknesses _inside_ your resources (like outdated software).
- **GuardDuty:** Watches for bad guys or strange behavior _happening in_ your AWS environment.
- **Detective:** Helps you figure out the "who, what, when, where, and why" _after_ GuardDuty (or another service) raises an alarm.
