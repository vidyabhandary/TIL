### Homomorphic encryption

Came across this fascinating bit of information that we can do [mathematical operations on encrypted data](https://www.weeklycspaper.com/archive/google-but-the-private-way-using-homomorphic-encryption-to-fix-the-internet/) from [Simon Frey's](https://www.weeklycspaper.com/archive/) weekly CS paper newsletter.

One of the uses of this type of operation is to get information from a server without the server knowing which information that client asked.

The following blog post is an in depth understanding along with the code - [Private information retrieval using homomorphic encryption (explained from scratch)](https://blintzbase.com/posts/pir-and-fhe-from-scratch)

I read it to get an intuitive understanding but I need to ruminate on it some more to understand in depth. However the concept itself was interesting enough that I thought to add in my TIL !!!
