**The key idea with Avro is that the writer’s schema and the reader’s schema don’t have to be the same—they only need to be compatible. When data is decoded (read), the Avro library resolves the differences by looking at the writer’s schema and the reader’s schema side by side and translating the data from the writer’s schema into the reader’s schema.**
