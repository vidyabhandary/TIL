EC2 Instance Savings Plans vs Compute Savings Plans

Table summarizing the key differences between EC2 Instance Savings Plans and Compute Savings Plans:

| Feature/Category      | EC2 Instance Savings Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Compute Savings Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope of Coverage** | **EC2 instances only** within a specific AWS Region and Instance Family (e.g., m5 in us-east-1).                                                                                                                                                                                | **EC2 instances** (any region, family, size, OS, tenancy) + **AWS Fargate** + **AWS Lambda**.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Flexibility**       | **Lower.** Savings apply _only_ to the chosen instance family and region. You can change size (e.g., m5.large to m5.xlarge), OS, or tenancy _within_ that family/region without losing the discount. Changing family or region means the discount won't apply to the new usage. | **Higher.** Savings automatically apply across _any_ EC2 instance usage globally, regardless of region, instance family, size, OS, or tenancy. Also covers Fargate and Lambda usage.                                                         |
| **Potential Savings** | **Highest potential savings** for EC2 (up to 72% compared to On-Demand prices). This is because the commitment is more specific.                                                                                                                                                | **Significant savings** (up to 66% compared to On-Demand EC2 prices). Slightly lower maximum discount than EC2 SP due to the increased flexibility. Savings also apply to Fargate and Lambda.                                                |
| **Commitment**        | Commit to a specific amount of usage ($/hour) for a chosen **Instance Family** in a chosen **Region**.                                                                                                                                                                          | Commit to a specific amount of usage ($/hour) for **Compute** usage across applicable services.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Ideal Use Case**    | Users with very stable, predictable usage of a specific EC2 instance family within a single region, prioritizing maximum possible savings for that specific workload.                                                                                                           | Users with dynamic compute needs, modernizing applications (e.g., moving to containers/serverless), using multiple regions/instance families, or wanting the simplicity of one plan covering broader compute usage. Prioritizes flexibility. |
| **Term Options**      | 1 year or 3 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1 year or 3 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Payment Options**   | All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Management**        | Purchased/Managed via AWS Cost Explorer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Purchased/Managed via AWS Cost Explorer                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**In essence:**

- **EC2 Savings Plan:** Offers the _deepest_ discount but locks you into a specific instance _family_ and _region_. Best for highly predictable, stable EC2 workloads where maximizing savings is key.
- **Compute Savings Plan:** Offers slightly _less_ maximum discount but provides significantly _more flexibility_, automatically applying savings across various EC2 configurations globally, plus Fargate and Lambda. Best for flexibility, modernization, or simplifying commitment across diverse compute services.
