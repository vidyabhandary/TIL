# Beta-VAE / CVAE

**Beta-VAE** is an extension of the **original VAE**.

- It is an extension of **VAE**.
- **Beta-VAE** introduces a **hyperparameter** (often denoted as Î², beta).
- This hyperparameter is used to explicitly control the trade-off between two aspects: the _reconstruction quality_ and the _disentanglement_ of the latent space.
- The model aims for the creation of more interpretable _disentangled representations_.

In simpler terms, **Beta-VAE** is described as a more flexible version of the **original VAE**. It allows researchers to adjust how much the model focuses on either recreating _exact details_ (reconstruction) or understanding the _underlying, independent factors of variation_ (disentanglement) within the data.

This is compared to teaching an art student to not just copy a painting but also to understand and separate key elements like _color_, _shape_, and _style_.

The ability to disentangle features makes **Beta-VAE** particularly useful in fields such as computer vision and robotics.

For example, **Beta-VAE** has been used by researchers to teach robots to understand objects better. This is done by learning to separate features such as _size_, _color_, and _position_. This separation of features helps robots to recognize and manipulate objects more easily in different situations, which makes them more adaptable and efficient in various tasks.

A **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** is a type of _generative model_ that allows for more _targeted outputs_ compared to a **standard VAE** by incorporating extra _conditioning information_.

Instead of generating arbitrary data similar to the training set, it can produce samples that belong to _specific categories or styles_, akin to an artist who can paint on request in different styles.

This ability to _control the generation process_ makes **CVAEs** particularly useful for _practical tasks_ like _generating specific content_ in computer games based on _desired conditions_.

- Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE): A type of variational autoencoder that allows for the generation process to be influenced by extra information, typically class labels.
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE): A type of neural network model used for learning latent representations of data and generating new data similar to the training set.
- Conditioning: The process of providing a model, such as a CVAE, with extra information to guide its output or generation process.
- Class Labels: Categories or tags associated with data points in a dataset, used as conditioning information in a CVAE to generate data belonging to a specific category.
- Procedural Content Generation: The algorithmic creation of game content or other media, often used to generate elements like levels, characters, or music.
- Latent Space: A lower-dimensional representation of the input data learned by an autoencoder, capturing the underlying structure and features.
