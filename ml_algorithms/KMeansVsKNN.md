# K-Means vs KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)

|  **K-means** 	|  **KNN** 	|
|---	|---	|
|  **K-means** clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm	|   **KNN** is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is supervised because you are trying to label a set of points based on a labeled set of other points	|
|   **K-means** is used for Clustering 	|   **KNN** is used mostly for Classification, and sometimes for Regression |
|  'K' in **K-means** is the number of clusters that the algorithm is trying to identify from the data. The clusters are not known in advance  	|  'K' in **KNN** is the number of nearest neighbors used to classify or predict a test sample. It is a lazy learning algorithm. 'K' must be an odd number to avoid an equal number of votes 	|
|  **K-means** picks center of cluster at random first, runs iterations until centroids (mean of the clusters) stabilise 	|   **KNN** - It measures which point belongs to which classification using a distance calculation	|
| Eg of usage - Using **K-means** one you can figure out who your customers are, what they have in common. | Eg of usage - With **KNN** you can figure out what items customers purchase together.
