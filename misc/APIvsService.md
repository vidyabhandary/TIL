# Difference between API and Service

| Feature           | API (Application Programming Interface)                                                                 | Service                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | A specific set of rules and protocols for interacting with software components, enabling data exchange. | A functional entity or application that performs tasks, often encapsulating business logic and processes.                           |
| **Purpose**       | Acts as a bridge for applications to access and use functionalities of other systems or services.       | Provides operational capabilities, often implementing complex business processes.                                                   |
| **Nature**        | Typically stateless and designed for requests and responses; focused on data access and manipulation.   | Can be stateful, maintaining context between interactions; focuses on performing actions and managing data lifecycle.               |
| **Granularity**   | More granular, exposing specific functionalities as discrete endpoints (e.g., CRUD operations).         | Coarser granularity; encapsulates multiple related functionalities and may handle complex workflows.                                |
| **Communication** | Typically communicates using HTTP/HTTPS protocols, gRPC; often used for remote procedure calls.         | Can communicate via various methods (HTTP/HTTPS, RMI, messaging queues, gRPC etc.) and can be part of a microservices architecture. |
| **Dependency**    | May rely on underlying services for execution but is primarily an interface for interaction.            | Operates independently or as part of a larger system; can be accessed via APIs.                                                     |
| **Use Case**      | A payment gateway API that allows an e-commerce site to process payments securely (e.g., Stripe API).   | A payment processing service that handles transactions, fraud detection, and reconciliation, offering an API for external access.   |

### Business Use Cases:

1. **API Use Case**:

   - **Scenario**: A mobile app needs to display weather data.
   - **Implementation**: The app calls a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch current weather information using specific endpoints. The API allows developers to access specific data without dealing with the underlying weather data processing.

2. **Service Use Case**:
   - **Scenario**: An online food delivery platform manages orders, payments, and delivery.
   - **Implementation**: The platform has a "Order Management Service" that processes incoming orders, manages the kitchen workflow, calculates delivery times, and interacts with a payment processing service. This service may expose an API for the mobile app to place orders but also handles complex business logic related to order fulfillment and delivery.
