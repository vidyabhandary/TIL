Comparison of **NS**, **A**, and **AAAA** DNS records:

| Feature           | **NS (Name Server)**                             | **A (Address)**                            | **AAAA (Quad-A)**                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**       | Delegates DNS authority to specific name servers | Maps domain name to an **IPv4 address**    | Maps domain name to an **IPv6 address** |
| **Points to**     | DNS server domain name (e.g., `ns1.example.com`) | IPv4 address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`)           | IPv6 address (e.g., `2001:db8::1`)      |
| **Used For**      | DNS **zone delegation** and control              | Routing traffic to servers via IPv4        | Routing traffic to servers via IPv6     |
| **DNS Hierarchy** | Defines **who manages** the DNS zone             | Directs clients to server IP               | Directs clients to server IPv6 address  |
| **Common Use**    | Set by domain registrar to delegate to DNS host  | Most websites and APIs still use A records | Increasing use as IPv6 adoption grows   |

### In short:

* **NS** = "Who knows the address?" (Name server)
* **A** = "Where is it? (IPv4)"
* **AAAA** = "Where is it? (IPv6)"

Think of **NS** as the address book owner, and **A/AAAA** as the actual entries in that book.
