# LBaaS (load balancing as a service)

LBaaS is a service offered by cloud providers that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers in your application's backend. This ensures:

- High Availability: If one server gets overloaded or fails, traffic automatically reroutes to healthy servers, preventing downtime for your application.
- Improved Performance: By distributing traffic, LBaaS reduces wait times and improves responsiveness for end-users.
- Scalability: You can easily scale your application up or down by adding or removing servers from the pool managed by the load balancer.

Certainly! Here's an example of LBaaS (Load Balancing as a Service) offered by various cloud vendors:

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:

4. **IBM Cloud**:

   - **Service**: IBM Cloud Load Balancer
   - **Description**: IBM Cloud Load Balancer is a fully managed, software-defined, Layer 4-7 load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers or resources. It provides scalability, high availability, and health monitoring for your applications.

5. **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**:
   - **Service**: Load Balancing
   - **Description**: OCI's Load Balancing service distributes incoming internet and private network traffic across multiple backend servers or instances. It supports HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, and UDP traffic, and offers features such as session persistence and health checks.
